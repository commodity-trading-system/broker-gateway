Open Source [FIX Protocol](http://www.fixprotocol.org/) library implemented in Go

Getting Started and Documentation
---------------------------------

* [User Manual](http://quickfixgo.org/docs)
* [API Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix)

### Installation

To install QuickFIX/Go, use `go get`:

```sh
$ go get github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix
```

### Staying up to date

To update QuickFIX/Go to the latest version, use `go get -u github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix`.

### Example Apps

See [examples](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples) for some simple examples of using QuickFIX/Go.

### FIX Message Generation

QuickFIX/Go includes fields, enums, messages, and message components generated from the FIX 4.0 - FIX5.0SP2 specs. For most FIX applications, these generated resources are sufficient. Custom FIX applications may generate source specific to the FIX spec of that application using the `generate-fix` tool included with QuickFIX/Go.

Following installation, `generate-fix` is installed to `$GOPATH/bin/generate-fix`. Run `$GOPATH/bin/generate-fix --help` for usage instructions.

Developing QuickFIX/Go
----------------------

If you wish to work on QuickFIX/Go itself, you will first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.6+ is *required*).

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

Next, using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), clone this repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix`. 

### Installing Dependencies

QuickFIX/Go uses [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) to manage the vendored dependencies. Install govendor with `go get`:

```sh
$ go get github.com/kardianos/govendor
```

Run `govendor sync` to install the correct versioned dependencies into `vendor/, which Go 1.6+ automatically recognizes and loads.

```sh
$ $GOPATH/bin/govendor sync
```

**Note:** No vendored dependencies are included in the QuickFIX/Go source.

### Build and Test

The default make target runs [go vet](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet) and unit tests.

```sh
$ make
```

If this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!

### Acceptance Tests

QuickFIX/Go has a comprehensive acceptance test suite covering the FIX protocol.  These are the same tests used across all QuickFIX implementations.

QuickFIX/Go acceptance tests depend on ruby in path.

To run acceptance tests,

		# build acceptance test rig
		make build_accept

		# run acceptance tests
		make accept

### Generated Code

For convenience, generated code from the FIX40-FIX50SP2 specs are included in the QuickFIX/Go repo.  The source specifications for this generated code is located in `spec/`.  Generated code can be identified by the `.generated.go` suffix.  Any changes to generated code must be captured by changes to source in `cmd/generate-fix`.  After making changes to the code generator source, run the following to re-generate the source

```sh
$ make generate
```

If you are making changes to the generated code, you will need to include the generated source in the same Pull Request as the changes made to the code generator. You should do this in a separate commit from your code, as this makes PR review easier and Git history simpler to read in the future.

### Dependencies

If you are developing QuickFIX/Go, there are a few tasks you might need to perform related to dependencies.

#### Adding a dependency

If you are adding a dependency, you will need update the govendor manifest in the same Pull Request as the code that depends on it. You should do this in a separate commit from your code, as this makes PR review easier and Git history simpler to read in the future.

To add a dependency:

Assuming your work is on a branch called `my-feature-branch`, the steps look like this:

1. Add the new package to your GOPATH:

    ```bash
    go get github.com/quickfixgo/my-project
    ```

2.  Add the new package to your vendor/ directory:

    ```bash
    govendor add github.com/quickfixgo/my-project
    ```

3. Review the changes in git and commit them.

#### Updating a dependency

To update a dependency:

1. Fetch the dependency:

    ```bash
    govendor fetch github.com/quickfixgo/my-project
    ```

2. Review the changes in git and commit them.
